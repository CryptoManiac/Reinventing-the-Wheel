Elliptic curve cryptography

## ECDSA

This directory contains the side channel attack resistant ECDSA implementation. Supports signing and signature verification as well as shared key generation (ECDH) on top of all commonly used Weierstrass curves: secp160r1, secp192r1, secp224r1, secp256r1, secp384r1 and secp521r1. Also supports the secp256k1 Koblitz curve.

## EdDSA

This directory contains the secure Ed25519 implementation. Supports signing and signature verification as well as shared key generation.

## EllipticCommon

Interfaces and some shared objects.
